# X-Team 83 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
First we will split up tasks among team members. Then, team members will specify which task they want to complete for the assignment. If a task isn't working for someone, they will reach out to the other team members and will switch tasks with someone else. 


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
First we will split up tasks among team members. Then, team members will specify which task they want to complete for the assignment. If a task isn't working for someone, they will reach out to the other team members and will switch tasks with someone else.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We can send e-mails to each other or we can communicate through the snap chat. If there are some problems we cannot fix online, we will meet each other to figure out how to solve them.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
If someone says that they will not be able to meet the deadline on their task, have at least one other person take a part of their task to help complete it before the deadline.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
